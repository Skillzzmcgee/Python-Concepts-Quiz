# Python-Concepts-Quiz

This program uses the Python programming language, with the modules tkinter, breezypythongui, and random.

The program consists of a breezypythongui based interface, which initially prompts the user of
the directions/instructions of the game, followed by the quiz beginning once the instructions box is closed.

The quiz is multiple-choice based and consists of 10 questions based on Python concepts, which uses a text file
to read its questions from. 

The user will select the radio-button answer in which they believe is the correct answer to the question displayed, 
followed by selecting the "submit" button. If the users answer to the question was correct, it will be displayed as
"Correct", or "Incorrect" if the answer was incorrect, within the results box.

Once all 10 questions have been answered, the user will be prompted
of their score out of 10(for example 6/10, 4/10, 9/10, etc).
